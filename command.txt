Sender side command:
mm-delay 5 mm-loss uplink 0.2 mm-loss downlink 0.5
./obj/rdt_sender $MAHIMAHI_BASE 5454 sample.txt

Receiver side command:
./obj/rdt_receiver 5454 receiver.txt

You can test your task 1 using these network conditions (run sender in
these conditions) and files:

Test 1
Network condition: mm-delay 30 mm-loss downlink 0.6
Transfer file: numbers.txt (4.5 MB)

Test 2
Network condition: mm-delay 50 mm-loss uplink 0.6
Transfer file: file.pdf (1 MB)

Test 3
Network condition: mm-delay 20 mm-link --meter-all ./channel_traces/cellular ./channel_traces/rapid
Transfer file: file.mp4 (17.8 MB)


In all of tests:
Check your code doesn't crash while transferring
Check files are not corrupt
Check files have the same content
Check files are of same sizes (check bytes in file properties)
